# Certificates
Here you can find all certificates I earned. While I learn for the skill, not the certificate, I still want to gather them here to show the effort I made and prove my determination.<br>
I'd also like to point out that obtaining these courses, exams and certifications directly in English proves my language knowledge at the B2/C1 level.<br> 
I'm constantly working on improving my skills, especially in the fields of SQL and Power BI / DAX.<br>
My current goal is to prepare and to pass the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst (PL-300) exam.<br>
<br>
