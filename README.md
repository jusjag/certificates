# Certificates :star2:
All of my course and training certificates are here so I won't spam my LinkedIn account.<br><br>
I'm aware that many of you find online certificates, well, questionable. And I don't learn for certificates, I learn for the skills. <br>
However, I decided to gather them here to show the effort I made and prove that I'm still learning and developing my skills.<br><br>

<b>Intro to Data Sprint & Challenge</b> from <b>Cofe Forst Girls</b><br>
Another short course & project from Code First Girls. Much much more simple than the course above, but I used it as a quick seminder and another short project inspiration. The project I made was about segregation of garbage in a small company :) Maybe one day I'll put it here too.<br>

## Google Analytics 4
After finishing the Google & SGH Skills of Tomorrow course, I was considering turning into the web analytics path. Finally I decided to focus on SQL and Power BI, but the Google Analytics Certificate is still with me and I'm sure I'd be able to use this tool after a quick reminder.<br>
<i>'By earning the Google Analytics Certification, Google recognizes your ability to:<br>
Setup a Google Analytics 4 property for a website or an app<br>
Collect the data you need for your business and use the various reporting tools and features<br>
Recognize key measurement features that can show the effectiveness of your online marketing efforts'</i><br>
